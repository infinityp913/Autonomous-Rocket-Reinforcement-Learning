# Autonomous-Rocket-Reinforcement-Learning
To use Reinforcement Learning to solve the problem of guiding an autonomous rocket through an asteroid belt. This is crucial for space exploration missions in the outer solar system.  For this project we're using a grid-based approximation of an asteroid belt.
